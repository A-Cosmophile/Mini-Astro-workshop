# Pre-Workshop Instructions
To get a working *bash* login shell which is essential for the workshop. If you already have *bash* or know how to get one, please ignore this sub-section and move onto the next one. One can also dual-boot or remove windows and fresh install Ubunutu or other linux distro but please do only if you are familiar with the terminal.

* MacOS:
  * Please make sure your default login shell is 'bash'. Previous versions of macOS except catalina came with bash as the default login shell.
But if you have macOS catalina installed and if login shell is zsh or something else, 
you can switch to 'bash'. Follow this [webpage](https://www.howtogeek.com/444596/how-to-change-the-default-shell-to-bash-in-macos-catalina/) for more details.

* Windows:
You have a choice to either install WSL1 or WSL2, we suggest WSL1 as it is light-weight on the side of resource consumption and additional layers.
  * Win10 or previous versions, doesn't come wiht a pre-installed bash shell. To to be able to use bash-linux commands on Windows, one has to either install WSL or WLS-2. More details on how to install can be found [here](https://www.windowscentral.com/install-windows-subsystem-linux-windows-10#install_linux_subsystem_settings_windows10). 
  * When asked for a linux distro, please choose Ubuntu or any other linux distro too if you have researched about various distros previously.
  * If you already know how to use powershell on windows, follow these [steps](https://www.windowscentral.com/install-windows-subsystem-linux-windows-10#install_linux_subsystem_powershell_windows10) to install WSL 1.
